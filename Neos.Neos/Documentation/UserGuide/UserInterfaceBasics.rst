a print style and a default Desktop style.

The Property Inspector gives you detailed property editing options for the chosen nodetype, whether this be
a page or a content element.

7. The Structure tree
---------------------

The Structure tree is a nodetype tree which gives you detailed information of how your content is structured.
It gives you information about which type, its position and its nesting level. This can also be used to navigate
the content of a page.

In the example the headline `Imagine thisâ€¦` is a child of `Content colection (column0)`, a grandchild of
`Two column content` and  a grandgrandchild of `Content collection (main)`.

8. The content canvas
---------------------

The content canvas is where you can add/edit your content.

9. Discard / Apply changes

Neos saves your changes on the fly as much as possible. When editing properties you must apply or discard
the changes you made.
