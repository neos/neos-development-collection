=================

.. note:: For documentation on how to create validators for the legacy Ember version of the user interface, refer to the older versions of the documentation.

The custom validators are created similarly to custom :ref:`custom-editors`.

Refer to :ref:`ui-extensibility` for detailed information on the topic.
