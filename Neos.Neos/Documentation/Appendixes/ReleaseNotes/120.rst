==================
1.2.0 (2014-12-10)
==================

The third release of Neos focuses on adding translation support, improving the editor experience and implementing
many new features. Neos is getting closer to being able to solve most project needs without custom code.

A lot of work has been put into this release to deliver a truly great user experience. Check out the online demo site
(http://neos.demo.typo3.org/) for trying out the new version.

In total 94 new features, 339 tasks and 282 bugfixes made it into the beta and more non-breaking improvements will come
during the finalization phase.

Upgrading from 1.1 can be done easily using the available migrations. Instructions available here
http://neos.typo3.org/develop/download/upgrade-instructions-1-2.html. If you experience any issues please report them
to https://jira.typo3.org/browse/NEOS.

A big thanks goes out to all the contributors that made this happen.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Translation support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Support for creating localized websites with Neos is years in the making. We took all the experience from a decade of
TYPO3 CMS customer projects into account and came up with a universal concept: Content Dimensions. This feature, which
is deeply rooted in Neos’ content repository, allows for creating and combining an arbitrary number of variants of a
piece of content. In Neos 1.2 we use Content Dimensions for realizing translations. Once the site integrator has
defined which languages should be available, an editor can translate content by simply navigating to the part of the
website he’d like to translate, switch to another language and type away.

All aspects of a node – which is the technical term for any kind of content - can be translated. A new implementation
of the routing component for Neos even allows for translation and customization of the URL of a particular document.

For a first impression you might want to watch a talk about multi language websites with Neos 1.2 from this year’s
T3CON: http://rlmk.me/neosmulti1-2

Information about the general UI approach to localization and full use of content dimensions, some of the planned
concepts are explained at http://rasmusskjoldan.com/post/82289319462/localization-is-not-about-localization

Many more features regarding content translation and content dimensions in general are on our roadmap.

See the chapter :ref:`content-dimensions` for details.

~~~~~~~~~~~
Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~

In a typical project, you will create lots of custom node types. However, many node types should only be
used in a specific context and not everywhere. Using *node type constraints*, it is now possible to restrict the allowed
child node types inside a given node type. Additionally for being able to specify direct child node constraints, it is
also possible to specify grandchild constraints for auto-created node types.

See the chapter :ref:`node-constraints` for details.

Node type constraints are supported in the following places in Neos:

- "Create New" panel in content element handles
- "Create New" panel in the navigate component (document and structure tree)
- moving in Navigate component
- changing node type in the inspector

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
!!! Breaking changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Move ImageTag and ImageUri TypoScript objects to Neos.Neos
   Replace all occurrences of ``TYPO3.Media:Image*`` with ``Neos.Neos:Image*`` to adjust your code.
- Serialized image objects cause Doctrine errors
   Images inserted in existing sites cause fatal errors. Running ``./doctrine migrate`` solves the issue.
- Rename "Insert records" content element
   To adjust your existing "Insert records" nodes, run the following node migration: ``./flow node:migrate 20141210114800``
- Move FlowQueryOperations concerning nodes to TYPO3CR
   Breaking if you extended existing FlowQueryOperations concerning nodes
- Fix linking behavior
   Links to shortcut nodes now point to the end target instead of intermediary URLs
- HTML editor: Make button label and highlighting mode configurable
   This is breaking if you used the HtmlEditor in your node types. To adjust, you need to replace *HtmlEditor*
   with *CodeEditor*, either manually or with ./flow core:migrate --package-key <your package>
- Use node label for link.node view helper
   This is breaking since it changes the behavior of empty links, so if you relied on that you need to use the
   f:link.uri view helper inside the href attribute of a normal a tag.
- Update Aloha editor
   b and i tags are now replaced with strong and em (old ones can still be configured).

   Now automatically adds paragraph around non formatted blocks.

   Target _blank is now added automatically to external links.
- Harmonize TypoScript paths
   The old path ``Private/TypoScripts(/Library)/Root.ts2`` is deprecated in favor of ``/Private/Fusion/Root.ts2``
- Add ability to Shortcut to an external target
   To adjust your existing Shortcut nodes, run the following node migration: ``./flow node:migrate 20140930125621``
- Switch to PHP date format for inspector date editor
   To adjust the code use the new format, it should be enough to run this on your site package(s):
   ``./flow flow:core:migrate --package-key <sitepackagekey>``
- Deprecate unused IncludeJavaScriptViewHelper
- Menu state should not be calculated based on a shortcut
   This is only breaking compared to the 1.1 branch not to 1.0. If you need a link to the site root page with correct
   active state you shouldn't create a shortcut pointing to it but rather include the real site root in the menu, by
   using the itemCollection property of the Menu TypoScript object.
- Hide document layout properties by default
   If you rely on these properties, adjust your node type configuration by setting the group on the two layout
   properties.
- Change default inline editing options
   Disables the underline tag as well as sub- and super script tags by default. They can be enabled again with
   configuration.
- Use strong and em instead of b and i as default
   Breaking if relying on non-native browser styling of b and i tags.
- Mark NodeInterface::getFullLabel deprecated
   The getFullLabel method is now deprecated. The getLabel method returns the full label instead.
- New node label management
   The code migration 20140911160326 takes care of changing existing implementations of the old
   ``NodeLabelGeneratorInterface`` to the deprecated ``NodeDataLabelGeneratorInterface`` and to change the NodeTypes
   configuration to the new format.
- Node Migrations work on NodeData
   This is considered breaking if you added your own Transformations or Filters for Node Migrations or rely on them to
   only apply to a specific workspace.
- Change handling of empty, false and null attribute values
   This will be breaking if code relied on the previous conversion of values or the output is used for XML, where the
   new meta property ``@allowEmpty`` should be used to disable empty attributes.
