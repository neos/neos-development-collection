=====
4.0.0
=====

Neos 4.0 is the next major version and comes with numerous changes, and a few additional features.
Since some refactoring has happeend, developers will need to get familiar with a few changes.

Assets sources support for Neos Media
=====================================

With this feature it is now possible to integrate remote asset
libraries into Neos own media browser. You can search through these
assets and import them into Neos for usage in the website.
Adapters making use of this are currently being build, but the API is
available for your integrations as well.

‚ÄúDocumentType‚Äù rendering entry point for Fusion
===============================================

If you provide a Fusion prototype with the same name as your Document NodeType,
it will automatically be used for rendering those Document Nodes now.
This aligns Document rendering with the way Content rendering happens
by default and so should make it easier to use and understand.

In general we favor using of a prototype for rendering documents now instead
of paths (like the "page" fusion path). To that effect a newly created site
will now only have a prototype for a (also created) custom Document NodeType.

Change default charset and collation to utf8mb4
===============================================

We now use utf8mb4 in MySQL compatible database to store strings.
That means you can now use the full range of unicode characters anywhere
and especially in Neos content. Yes, also emoji üòÇ

It also means your existing database must be updated to the new charset.

Layout is now only supported with the NodeTypes package
=======================================================

We consider the layout property not a best practice, and therefore
recommend not using it and relying on NodeTypes instead. To allow for
backwards compatibility the matcher that automatically renders a fusion path
with the same name as layout / sublayout is not removed yet though but moved
to the NodeTypes package that makes use of it in the Page NodeType declared
in that package. The NodeTypes package itself is also not recommended as
best practice. Instead create your own set of NodeTypes, maybe based on the
Neos.NodeTypes.BaseMixins package.

Font Awesome 5 usage
====================

We switched to the free version of the latest Font Awesome, that means
more icons for you to use but also that you need to adapt to Font Awesome 5
icons and notation. You need to adapt custom backend modules by simply using
the new icon classes as seen on  https://fontawesome.com/ .
The `icon-` prefix way of defining NodeType icons still works fine, but you
can also switch to FA5 notation to get more specific about the icon you want.
This change was made for the legacy and React UI as well as the Neos
backend modules.
