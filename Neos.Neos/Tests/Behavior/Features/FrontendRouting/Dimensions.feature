Feature: Routing functionality with multiple content dimensions

  Background:
    Given I have the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values      | Generalizations |
      | market     | DE, CH      | CH->DE          |
      | language   | en, de, gsw | gsw->de->en     |
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"

    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                | Value           |
      | workspaceName      | "live"          |
