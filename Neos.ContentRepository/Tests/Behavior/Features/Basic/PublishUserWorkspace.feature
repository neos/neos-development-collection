Feature: Publish user workspace
  In order to have changes in the live workspace
  As an API user of the content repository
  I need support to publish changes in a workspace

  Background:
    Given I have the following nodes:
      | Identifier                           | Path                 | Node Type                  | Properties        | Workspace |
      | ecf40ad1-3119-0a43-d02e-55f8b5aa3c70 | /sites               | unstructured               |                   | live      |
      | fd5ba6e1-4313-b145-1004-dad2f1173a35 | /sites/content-repository       | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Page | {"title": "Home"} | live      |

  @fixtures
  Scenario: Publish a new ContentCollection with Content
    When I create the following nodes:
      | Path                                          | Node Type                               | Properties              | Workspace |
      | /sites/content-repository/main/twocol                    | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:TwoColumn         | {}                      | user-demo |
      | /sites/content-repository/main/twocol/column0/text       | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Text              | {"text": "Hello world"} | user-demo |
    And I am authenticated with role "Neos.Neos:Administrator"
    And I publish the workspace "user-demo"
    And I get a node by path "/sites/content-repository/main/twocol/column0/text" with the following context:
      | Workspace |
      | live      |
    Then I should have one node

  @fixtures
  Scenario: Unpublished nodes returns the correct count before publish
    And I create the following nodes:
      | Path                               | Node Type                       | Properties              | Workspace |
      | /sites/content-repository/twocol              | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:TwoColumn | {}                      | user-demo |
      | /sites/content-repository/twocol/column0/text | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Text      | {"text": "Hello world"} | user-demo |
    # We expect 4, the 2 column element with 2 columns (3) and the text element (1)
    Then I expect to have 4 unpublished nodes for the following context:
      | Workspace |
      | user-demo |

  @fixtures
  Scenario: Unpublished nodes returns the correct count after publish
    And I create the following nodes:
      | Path                               | Node Type                       | Properties              | Workspace |
      | /sites/content-repository/twocol              | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:TwoColumn | {}                      | user-demo |
      | /sites/content-repository/twocol/column0/text | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Text      | {"text": "Hello world"} | user-demo |
    And I publish the workspace "user-demo"
    Then I expect to have 0 unpublished nodes for the following context:
      | Workspace |
      | user-demo |

  @fixtures
  Scenario: Unpublished nodes will return an empty array for the live workspace
    Then I expect to have 0 unpublished nodes for the following context:
      | Workspace |
      | live      |

  @fixtures
  Scenario: When changing the node type of a node in my workspace to one that has fewer properties it is possible to publish it
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'unstructured':
      constraints:
        nodeTypes:
          '*': TRUE

    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Page':
      properties:
        pageTitle:
          type: 'string'
        additionalTitle:
          type: 'string'
    """
    And I create the following nodes:
      | Path        | Node Type                  | Properties                                                   | Workspace |
      | /sites/home | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Page | {"pageTitle": "neos", "additionalTitle": "The neos project"} | live      |
    When I get a node by path "/sites/home" with the following context:
      | Workspace |
      | user-demo |
    And I set the node property "pageTitle" to "Homepage"
    When I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'unstructured':
      constraints:
        nodeTypes:
          '*': TRUE

    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Page':
      properties:
        pageTitle:
          type: 'string'
    """
    And I publish the workspace "user-demo"
    Then I expect to have 0 unpublished nodes for the following context:
      | Workspace |
      | user-demo |
    And I get a node by path "/sites/home" with the following context:
      | Workspace |
      | live      |
    Then the node should not have a property "additionalTitle"
    Then the node property "pageTitle" should be "Homepage"
