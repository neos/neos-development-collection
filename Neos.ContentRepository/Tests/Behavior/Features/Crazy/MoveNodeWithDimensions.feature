Feature: Move node with dimension support
  In order to move nodes
  As an API user of the content repository
  I need support to move nodes and child nodes considering dimensions; moving all nodes across dimensions consistently (for aggregate nodes).

  Background:
    Given I have the following nodes:
      | Identifier                           | Path                   | Node Type                  | Properties                    | Workspace | Language |

  @fixtures
  Scenario: When a node is moved, this node's node path should change
    This is needed inside Neos, when moving nodes inside the Node Tree, the system has to return
    the updated Node Path to the User Interface. Thus, this test effectively checks whether
    NodeInterface->getPath() can be used to retrieve the updated path after node moving.

    When I get a node by path "/sites/content-repository/service" with the following context:
      | Workspace  | Language |
      | user-admin | en       |
    And I move the node into the node with path "/sites/content-repository/company"
    Then I should have the following nodes:
      | Path                           |
      | /sites/content-repository/company/service |

  @fixtures
  Scenario: When a node is moved, this node's node path should change, even with fallback dimensions configured
    See the description of the scenario above why this feature is important for Neos. This reproduces bug NEOS-1652.

      | Workspace  | Language |

    Then I should have the following nodes:
      | Path                           |
      | /sites/content-repository/company/service |
