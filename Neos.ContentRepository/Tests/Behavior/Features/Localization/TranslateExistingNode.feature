Feature: Translate existing node
  In order to translate existing content to new languages
  As an API user of the content repository
  I need a way to create node variant for other languages

  Background:
    Given I have the following nodes:
      | Identifier                           | Path                   | Node Type                  | Properties           | Language | Workspace |
      | ecf40ad1-3119-0a43-d02e-55f8b5aa3c70 | /sites                 | unstructured               |                      | mul_ZZ   | live      |
      | fd5ba6e1-4313-b145-1004-dad2f1173a35 | /sites/content-repository         | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Page | {"title": "Home"}    | mul_ZZ   | live      |
      | 68ca0dcd-2afb-ef0e-1106-a5301e65b8a0 | /sites/content-repository/company | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Page | {"title": "Company"} | en_ZZ    | live      |

  @fixtures
  Scenario: An existing node can be translated to a new language by adopting it from a different context
    When I get a node by path "/sites/content-repository/company" with the following context:
      | Language      |
      | en_ZZ, mul_ZZ |
    And I adopt the node to the following context:
      | Language      |
      | de_ZZ, mul_ZZ |
    And I set the node property "title" to "Unternehmen"

    When I get a node by path "/sites/content-repository/company" with the following context:
      | Language      |
      | de_ZZ, mul_ZZ |
    Then I should have one node
    And the node property "title" should be "Unternehmen"

    When I get a node by path "/sites/content-repository/company" with the following context:
      | Language      |
      | en_ZZ, mul_ZZ |
    Then I should have one node
    And the node property "title" should be "Company"

    And I adopt the node to the following context:
      | Language      | Workspace  |
      | de_ZZ, mul_ZZ | user-admin |
    And I set the node property "title" to "Unternehmen"

    When I get a node by path "/sites/content-repository/company" with the following context:
      | Language      | Workspace  |
      | de_ZZ, mul_ZZ | user-admin |
    Then I should have one node
    And the node property "title" should be "Unternehmen"

    When I get a node by path "/sites/content-repository/company" with the following context:
