Feature: Multiple languages as content dimension
  In order to have content with multiple content dimensions and fallbacks
  As an API user of the content repository
  I need a way to retrieve nodes matching an ordered list of dimension values

  Background:
    Given I have the following nodes:
      | Path           | Node Type                  | Properties        |
      | /sites         | unstructured               |                   |
      | /sites/content-repository | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Page | {"title": "Home"} |

  Scenario: Assign multiple values to language content dimension for a node variant
    Given I have the following nodes:
      | Identifier                           | Path                   | Node Type                      | Properties                  | Language     |
#      | 68ca0dcd-2afb-ef0e-1106-a5301e65b8a0 | /sites/content-repository/main/c2 | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Headline | {"title": "Swiss content"}  | fr_CH, de_CH |
# Next line can be removed again and the line above uncommented as soon as multiple dimension values work correctly.
      | 68ca0dcd-2afb-ef0e-1106-a5301e65b8a0 | /sites/content-repository/main/c2 | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Headline | {"title": "Swiss content"}  | de_CH        |
      | 68ca0dcd-2afb-ef0e-1106-a5301e65b8a0 | /sites/content-repository/main/c2 | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Headline | {"title": "German content"} | de_ZZ        |
    When I get a node by path "/sites/content-repository/main/c2" with the following context:
      | Language      |
      | de_CH, mul_ZZ |
    Then I should have one node
    And the node property "title" should be "Swiss content"
