# This Fusion prototype corresponds to the auto-generated document node type in
# the "Configuration/NodeTypes.Document.Page.yaml" file of your site package.
# It takes care of rendering pages of that type.
# If you removed that node type, you can also remove this Fusion prototype.
# If you want to understand how this page rendering works, have a look at
