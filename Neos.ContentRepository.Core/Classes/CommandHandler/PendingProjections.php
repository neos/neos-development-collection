/**
 * Implementation detail of {@see ContentRepository::handle()}; needed for implementing {@see CommandResult::block()}.
 *
 * It contains the {@see PendingProjections} (i.e. all affected projections by the command and their target sequence
 * number) for the blocking mechanism.
 *
 * It also contains the {@see CommitResult} that contains the highest sequence number and version of the published
 * events.
 *
 * ## Background: How does blocking work?
 *
 * We need to wait until the projection has consumed the events from our current command. This becomes a bit more
 * complicated in the implementation: For performance reasons, we do NOT send every event to every projection; but only
 * events which can be handled by a given projection (see the {@see ProjectionInterface::canHandle()} method).
 *
 * Let's add an example (time flows from left to right):
 *
 * ```
 * sequenceNumber:         2   3   4   5   6   7
 * projectionA:            x       x
 * projectionB:            x   x   x   x   x
 * projectionC:
 * ```
 *
 * `projectionA` is only interested in the events 2 and 4; projectionB in 2-6; and projectionC is not called at all.
 * This means the {@see CheckpointStorageInterface::getHighestAppliedSequenceNumber()} will return `4` for
 * `projectionA` and `6` for `projectionB` when the projections are all up to date.
 *
 * **Thus, we need to figure out how long to wait (until which sequence number) for each projection individually,
 * and this is what this class does.**
 *
 * ## Algorithm: Calculating the maximum-sequence-number for each projection
 *
 * (implemented in {@see PendingProjections::fromProjectionsAndEventsAndSequenceNumber()})
 *
 * As *input*, we get the highestCommittedSequenceNumber from {@see CommitResult::$highestCommittedSequenceNumber}; so
 * in the example above, this would be `7`. Additionally, we get the just-committed events (for which we want to
 * calculate the above), and all the projections.
 *
 * Additionally, we rely on the fact that the sequence number is monotonically increasing, **without gaps**. We then can
 * calculate the 1st sequence number by doing `highestCommittedSequenceNumber - count(events) + 1`; so in our example
 * above `7-6+1 = 2`.
 *
 * We then iterate over all sequence numbers (2-7 in the example) and ask each {@see ProjectionInterface::canHandle()}
 * whether it was interested in the event. We then remember the highest sequence number which each projection was
 * interested in.
 *
 * NOTE: We could also iterate backwards instead of forward - this would be a bit more efficient because we could break
 *       if we saw a projection for the first time; but maybe even more difficult code-wise.
 *
 * ## Blocking: Putting the parts together
 *
 * - The algorithm below is triggered by {@see ContentRepository::handle()}; and the resulting {@see PendingProjections}
 *   object is passed to {@see CommandResult}.
 * - {@see CommandResult::block()} does busy-waiting; repeatedly calling {@see ProjectionInterface::getSequenceNumber()}
 * - {@see ProjectionInterface::getSequenceNumber()} is typically implemented internally via
 *   {@see CheckpointStorageInterface::getHighestAppliedSequenceNumber()}.#
