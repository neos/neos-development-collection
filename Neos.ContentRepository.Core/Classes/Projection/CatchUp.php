/**
 *  This helper class is used to implement the orchestration of projection catch up; together with {@see CheckpointStorageInterface}.
 *
 *  It ensures that a given projection **never runs concurrently** and thus prevents race conditions where the same
 *  projector is accidentally running multiple times in parallel.
 *
 *  If you use the {@see \Neos\ContentRepository\Core\Infrastructure\DbalCheckpointStorage}, and share the same database connection with your projection,
 *  this class **implements Exactly-Once Semantics for your projections**, to ensure each event is seen EXACTLY once in your projection.
 *
 *  ## How does it work?
 *
 *  When you call {@see CatchUp::run()}, a lock is acquired via {@see CheckpointStorageInterface::acquireLock()}
 *  (e.g. from the database), to ensure we run only once (even if in a distributed system). For relational
 *  databases, this also starts a database transaction.
 *
 *  After every batchSize events (typically after every event), we update the sequence number and commit
 *  the transaction (via {@see CheckpointStorageInterface::updateAndReleaseLock()}). Then, we open a new transaction.
 *
 *  In case of errors, the transaction is rolled back. So event listeners with their own state best share the same
 *  database connection.
 *  If a new transaction is started on the same connection within the event listener callback, the transaction will be nested (@see https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/3.7/reference/transactions.html#transaction-nesting)
 *
