The Skype website says: "It must be between 6-32 characters, start with

Nevertheless dash and underscore are allowed as special characters.
Furthermore, account names can contain a colon if they were auto-created
trough a connected Microsoft or Facebook profile. In this case, the syntax
is as follows:
- live:john.due
- Facebook:john.doe

We added period and minus as additional characters because they are
suggested by Skype during registration.
