Neos Command Reference
======================

.. note:

  This reference uses ``./flow`` as the command to invoke. If you are on
  Windows, this will probably not work, there you need to use ``flow.bat``
  instead.

The commands in this reference are shown with their full command identifiers.
On your system you can use shorter identifiers, whose availability depends
on the commands available in total (to avoid overlap the shortest possible
identifier is determined during runtime).

To see the shortest possible identifiers on your system as well as further
commands that may be available, use::

  ./flow help

.. _`Neos Command Reference: TYPO3.FLOW`:

Package *TYPO3.FLOW*
--------------------


.. _`Neos Command Reference: TYPO3.FLOW typo3.flow:cache:flush`:

``typo3.flow:cache:flush``
**************************

**Flush all caches**

The flush command flushes all caches (including code caches) which have been
registered with Flow's Cache Manager. It also removes any session data.

If fatal errors caused by a package prevent the compile time bootstrap
from running, the removal of any temporary data can be forced by specifying
the option **--force**.

This command does not remove the precompiled data provided by frozen
packages unless the **--force** option is used.



Options
^^^^^^^

``--force``
  Force flushing of any temporary data



Related commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``typo3.flow:cache:warmup``
  Warm up caches
``typo3.flow:package:freeze``
  Freeze a package
``typo3.flow:package:refreeze``
  Refreeze a package



.. _`Neos Command Reference: TYPO3.FLOW typo3.flow:cache:flushone`:

``typo3.flow:cache:flushone``
*****************************

**Flushes a particular cache by its identifier**

Given a cache identifier, this flushes just that one cache. To find
the cache identifiers, you can use the configuration:show command with
the type set to "Caches".

Note that this does not have a force-flush option since it's not
meant to remove temporary code data, resulting into a broken state if
code files lack.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

``--identifier``
  Cache identifier to flush cache for





Related commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``typo3.flow:cache:flush``

.. _`Neos Command Reference: TYPO3.FLOW typo3.flow:cache:warmup`:

``typo3.flow:cache:warmup``
***************************

**Warm up caches**

The warm up caches command initializes and fills – as far as possible – all
registered caches to get a snappier response on the first following request.
Apart from caches, other parts of the application may hook into this command
and execute tasks which take further steps for preparing the app for the big
rush.

.. _`Neos Command Reference: TYPO3.FLOW typo3.flow:core:migrate`:

``typo3.flow:core:migrate``
***************************

**Migrate source files as needed**

This will apply pending code migrations defined in packages to all
packages that do not yet have those migration applied.

For every migration that has been run, it will create a commit in
the package. This allows for easy inspection, rollback and use of
the fixed code.
If the affected package contains local changes or is not part of
a git repository, the migration will be skipped. With the --force
flag this behavior can be changed, but changes will only be committed
if the working copy was clean before applying the migration.



Options
^^^^^^^

``--status``
  Show the migration status, do not run migrations
``--packages-path``
  If set, use the given path as base when looking for packages
``--package-key``
  If set, migrate only the given package
``--version``
  If set, execute only the migration with the given version (e.g. "20150119114100")
``--verbose``
  If set, notes and skipped migrations will be rendered
``--force``
  By default packages that are not under version control or contain local changes are skipped. With this flag set changes are applied anyways (changes are not committed if there are local changes though)



Related commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``typo3.flow:doctrine:migrate``
  Migrate the database schema



.. _`Neos Command Reference: TYPO3.FLOW typo3.flow:core:setfilepermissions`:

``typo3.flow:core:setfilepermissions``
**************************************

**Adjust file permissions for CLI and web server access**

This command adjusts the file permissions of the whole Flow application to
the given command line user and webserver user / group.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

``--commandline-user``
  User name of the command line user, for example "john
``--webserver-user``
  User name of the webserver, for example "www-data
``--webserver-group``
  Group name of the webserver, for example "www-data







.. _`Neos Command Reference: TYPO3.FLOW typo3.flow:core:shell`:

``typo3.flow:core:shell``
*************************

**Run the interactive Shell**

The shell command runs Flow's interactive shell. This shell allows for
entering commands like through the regular command line interface but
additionally supports autocompletion and a user-based command history.







.. _`Neos Command Reference: TYPO3.FLOW typo3.flow:database:setcharset`:

``typo3.flow:database:setcharset``
**********************************

**Convert the database schema to use the given character set and collation (defaults to utf8 and utf8_unicode_ci).**

This command can be used to convert the database configured in the Flow settings to the utf8 character
set and the utf8_unicode_ci collation (by default, a custom collation can be given). It will only
work when using the pdo_mysql driver.

**Make a backup** before using it, to be on the safe side. If you want to inspect the statements used
for conversion, you can use the $output parameter to write them into a file. This file can be used to do
the conversion manually.

For background information on this, see:

- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/766809/
- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/alter-table.html

The main purpose of this is to fix setups that were created with Flow 2.3.x or earlier and whose
database server did not have a default collation of utf8_unicode_ci. In those cases, the tables will
have a collation that does not match the default collation of later Flow versions, potentially leading
to problems when creating foreign key constraints (among others, potentially).

If you have special needs regarding the charset and collation, you *can* override the defaults with
different ones. One thing this might be useful for is when switching to the utf8mb4 character set, see:

- https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/mysql-utf8mb4
- https://florian.ec/articles/mysql-doctrine-utf8/

Note: This command **is not a general purpose conversion tool**. It will specifically not fix cases
of actual utf8 stored in latin1 columns. For this a conversion to BLOB followed by a conversion to the
proper type, charset and collation is needed instead.



Options
^^^^^^^

``--character-set``
  Character set, defaults to utf8
``--collation``
  Collation to use, defaults to utf8_unicode_ci
``--output``
  A file to write SQL to, instead of executing it

This function marks a package as **frozen** in order to improve performance
in a development context. While a package is frozen, any modification of files
within that package won't be tracked and can lead to unexpected behavior.

File monitoring won't consider the given package. Further more, reflection
data for classes contained in the package is cached persistently and loaded
directly on the first request after caches have been flushed. The precompiled
reflection data is stored in the **Configuration** directory of the
respective package.

and will remove the respective Asset object from the database when the broken resource is removed.

This command will ask you interactively what to do before deleting anything.







.. _`Neos Command Reference: TYPO3.FLOW typo3.flow:resource:copy`:

``typo3.flow:resource:copy``
****************************

**Copy resources**

This command copies all resources from one collection to another storage identified by name.
The target storage must be empty and must not be identical to the current storage of the collection.

This command merely copies the binary data from one storage to another, it does not change the related
Resource objects in the database in any way. Since the Resource objects in the database refer to a
collection name, you can use this command for migrating from one storage to another my configuring
the new storage with the name of the old storage collection after the resources have been copied.

set of actions. If no model or repository exists which matches the
controller name (for example "CoffeeRepository" for "CoffeeController"),
an error will be shown.

Likewise the command exits with an error if the specified package does not
exist. By using the --generate-related flag, a missing package, model or
repository can be created alongside, avoiding such an error.

By specifying the --generate-templates flag, this command will also create
matching Fluid templates for the actions created. This option can only be
used in combination with --generate-actions.

The default behavior is to not overwrite any existing code. This can be
overridden by specifying the --force flag.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

``--package-key``
  The package key of the package for the new controller with an optional subpackage, (e.g. "MyCompany.MyPackage/Admin").
``--controller-name``
  The name for the new controller. This may also be a comma separated list of controller names.
