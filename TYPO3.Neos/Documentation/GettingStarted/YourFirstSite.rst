   'orphan' is `file-wide-metadata`_ telling Sphinx, that it should
   not warn that the page is not included in any toctree. Must be at the
   top of this reST code.

================================
Creating your first Neos website
================================

To create a new site, use `Add site` in `Administration > Sites`.

...

Creating Content in Wireframe Mode
==================================

In Neos users can start adding content immediately after a site has been created, even
if no design has been implemented yet. This is possible with the `Raw Content` editing mode
that can be switched on Edit/Preview panel.

It allows the creation of arbitrary content elements, rendering everything in a stripped down representation.

===============

The :doc:`"Create a Site with Neos" <../CreatingASite/index>` guide contains everything else you need to know about building websites with Neos:

* :ref:`creating custom content elements <custom-content-elements>`

and more.
