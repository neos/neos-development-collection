h3. Overall UI Goals

We have set up the following goals to strive for UI-wise:

* Reliable editing
* Predictable UI Behavior
* Immeditate feedback for the user
* Built with the web - for the web

UI concepts should be evaluated against the above goals.

h3. Technical guidelines / goals

When implementing the user interface, we should follow these guidelines on a technical side:

* Take the pragmatic approach
* Augument the frontend website
* No iFrame in the content module
* Browser support >= IE9; in the prototyping phase focus on Firefox
* No polling of data from the server!

h3. CSS Guidelines

Overal Goal:

* Be pragmatic! We strive for solutions which work out-of-the-box in 95% of the cases; and tell the integrator
  how to solve the other 5%. Thus, the integrator has to care to make his CSS work with Phoenix; we do not use a sandbox.

Implementation notes:

* All CSS selectors should be fully lowercase, with @-@ as separator. Example: @t3-ui, t3-breadcrumb-item@
* We use the +t3-+ prefix
* The integrator is never allowed to override +t3-+ and +aloha-+
* The main UI elements have an ID, and a partial reset is used to give us predictable behavior inside them.
* We use *sass*. To install, use +gem install sass+. Then, before modifying CSS, go to css/ and run
  +sass --watch style.scss:style.css+. This will update style.css at every modification of style.scss.

h3. Naming of main UI parts

The following image shows the main UI parts and the names we use for them.

WARNING: TODO: Explain 'block selection'. It's a new term, and not completely clear when you read it for the first time.

The following diagram shows how a change of the block selection in Aloha updates
the UI.

When an attribute is modified through the property panel, the following happens:
