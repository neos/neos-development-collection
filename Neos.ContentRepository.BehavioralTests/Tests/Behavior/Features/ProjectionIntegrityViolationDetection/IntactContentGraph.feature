Feature: Create an intact content graph and run integrity violation detection

  As a user of the CR I want to be able to get an empty integrity violation detection result on an intact content graph

  Background:
    Given I have the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values  | Generalizations |
      | language   | de, gsw | gsw->de         |
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': []
    """
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                        | Value                                  |
      | workspaceName              | "live"                                 |
      | workspaceTitle             | "Live"                                 |
      | workspaceDescription       | "The live workspace"                   |
      | initiatingUserId   | "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" |
      | newContentStreamId | "cs-identifier"                        |

  Scenario: Create an intact content graph
    When the event RootNodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated was published with payload:
      | Key                         | Value                                  |
      | contentStreamId     | "cs-identifier"                        |
      | nodeAggregateId     | "lady-eleonode-rootford"               |
      | nodeTypeName                | "Neos.ContentRepository:Root"          |
      | coveredDimensionSpacePoints | [{"language":"de"},{"language":"gsw"}] |
      | initiatingUserId    | "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" |
      | nodeAggregateClassification | "root"                                 |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And the event NodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated was published with payload:
      | Key                           | Value                                     |
      | contentStreamId       | "cs-identifier"                           |

      | nodeAggregateClassification   | "regular"                                 |
    And the event NodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated was published with payload:
      | Key                           | Value                                     |
      | contentStreamId       | "cs-identifier"                           |
      | nodeAggregateId       | "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii"              |

      | nodeAggregateClassification   | "tethered"                                |
    And the event NodeReferencesWereSet was published with payload:
      | Key                                      | Value                                                                           |
      | contentStreamId                  | "cs-identifier"                                                                 |
      | sourceNodeAggregateId            | "nody-mc-nodeface"                                                              |
      | affectedSourceOriginDimensionSpacePoints | [{"language":"de"}]                                                             |
      | referenceName                            | "referenceProperty"                                                             |
      | references                               | [{"targetNodeAggregateId":"sir-david-nodenborough", "properties":null}] |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I run integrity violation detection
    Then I expect the integrity violation detection result to contain exactly 0 errors
