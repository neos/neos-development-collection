Feature: Copy nodes (without dimensions)

  Background:
    Given using no content dimensions
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document':
      references:
        ref: []
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                  | Value                |
      | workspaceName        | "live"               |
      | newContentStreamId   | "cs-identifier"      |
    And I am in workspace "live"
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                         |
      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |
      | nodeTypeName    | "Neos.ContentRepository:Root" |
    And the event NodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated was published with payload:

  Scenario: Copy
    When I am in workspace "live" and dimension space point {}
    # node to copy (currentNode): "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii"
    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii" to lead to node cs-identifier;sir-nodeward-nodington-iii;{}
    When the command CopyNodesRecursively is executed, copying the current node aggregate with payload:
      | Key                                    | Value                                                             |
      | targetDimensionSpacePoint              | {}                                                                |
      | targetParentNodeAggregateId            | "nody-mc-nodeface"                                                |
      | targetNodeName                         | "target-nn"                                                       |
      | targetSucceedingSiblingnodeAggregateId | null                                                              |
      | nodeAggregateIdMapping                 | {"sir-nodeward-nodington-iii": "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy"} |

    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy" to lead to node cs-identifier;sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy;{}

  Scenario: Copy References
    When I am in workspace "live" and dimension space point {}
    And the command SetNodeReferences is executed with payload:
      | Key                   | Value                                           |
      | sourceNodeAggregateId | "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii"                    |
      | references            | [{"referenceName": "ref", "references": [{"target": "sir-david-nodenborough"}]}] |

    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii" to lead to node cs-identifier;sir-nodeward-nodington-iii;{}
    And the command CopyNodesRecursively is executed, copying the current node aggregate with payload:
      | Key                                    | Value                                                             |
      | targetDimensionSpacePoint              | {}                                                                |
      | targetParentNodeAggregateId            | "nody-mc-nodeface"                                                |
      | targetNodeName                         | "target-nn"                                                       |
      | targetSucceedingSiblingnodeAggregateId | null                                                              |
      | nodeAggregateIdMapping                 | {"sir-nodeward-nodington-iii": "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy"} |

    And I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy" to lead to node cs-identifier;sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy;{}
    And I expect this node to have the following references:
      | Name    | Node                                    | Properties |
      | ref     | cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{} | null       |
