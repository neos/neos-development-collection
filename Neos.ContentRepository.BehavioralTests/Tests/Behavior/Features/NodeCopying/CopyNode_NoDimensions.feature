Feature: Copy nodes (without dimensions)

  Background:
    Given I have no content dimensions
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': []
    """
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:

  Scenario: Copy
    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {}
    # node to copy (currentNode): "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii"
    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii" to lead to node cs-identifier;sir-nodeward-nodington-iii;{}
    When the command CopyNodesRecursively is executed, copying the current node aggregate with payload:
      | Key                                            | Value                                                             |
      | contentStreamId                        | "cs-identifier"                                                   |
      | targetDimensionSpacePoint                      | {}                                                                |
      | targetParentNodeAggregateId            | "nody-mc-nodeface"                                                |
      | targetNodeName                                 | "target-nn"                                                       |
      | targetSucceedingSiblingnodeAggregateId | null                                                              |
      | nodeAggregateIdMapping                 | {"sir-nodeward-nodington-iii": "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy"} |

    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy" to lead to node cs-identifier;sir-nodeward-nodington-iii-copy;{}
