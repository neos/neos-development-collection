Feature: Publishing moved nodes without dimensions

  As a user of the CR I want to move a node
  - to the end of its siblings
  - before one of its siblings
  - to a new parent and the end of its children
  - to a new parent and before one of its children
  and then publish the result to the target workspace.

  These are the test cases for publishing moved nodes without content dimensions being involved

  Background:
    Given using no content dimensions
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': []
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                        | Value           |
      | workspaceName              | "live"          |
      | newContentStreamId | "cs-identifier" |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key                         | Value                                  |
