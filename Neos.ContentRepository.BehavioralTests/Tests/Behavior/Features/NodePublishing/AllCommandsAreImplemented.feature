Feature: Publishing hide/show scenario of nodes

  Node structure is as follows:
  - rn-identifier (root node)
  -- sir-david-nodenborough (name=text1) <== this one is modified and published
  --- nody-mc-nodeface (name=text2)
  -- sir-nodeward-nodington-iii (name=image) <== this one is modified

  The setup is always as follows:
  - we modify two nodes using a certain command (e.g. DisableNode) in the USER workspace
  - we publish one of them
  - we check that the user workspace still sees both nodes as hidden; and the live workspace only sees one of the changes.

  We do the same for other commands. This way, we ensure that both the command works generally;
  and the matchesNodeAddress() address of the command is actually implemented somehow properly.


  Background:
    Given using no content dimensions
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    Neos.ContentRepository:Root: {}
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Content':
      properties:
        text:
          type: string
        referenceProperty:
          type: reference
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Image':
      properties:
        image:
          type: string
    """

    And I am in content repository "default"
