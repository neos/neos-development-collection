Feature: Discard individual nodes (basics)

  Publishing an individual node works
  Node structure is as follows:
  - rn-identifier (root node)
  -- sir-david-nodenborough (name=text1) <== modifications!
  --- nody-mc-nodeface (name=text2) <== modifications!
  -- sir-nodeward-nodington-iii (name=image) <== modifications!


  Background:
    Given using no content dimensions
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    Neos.ContentRepository:Root: {}
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Content':
      properties:
        text:
          type: string
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Image':
      properties:
        image:
          type: string
    """
