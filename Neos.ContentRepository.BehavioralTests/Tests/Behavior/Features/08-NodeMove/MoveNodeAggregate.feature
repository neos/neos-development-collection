Feature: Move node to a new parent / within the current parent before a sibling / to the end of the sibling list

  As a user of the CR I want to move a node to a new parent / within the current parent before a sibling / to the end of the sibling list,
  without affecting other nodes in the node aggregate.

  These are the base test cases for the NodeAggregateCommandHandler to block invalid commands

  Content Structure:
    - lady-eleonode-rootford (Neos.ContentRepository:Root)
      - sir-david-nodenborough (Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:DocumentWithTetheredChildNode)
        - "tethered" nodewyn-tetherton (Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Content)
        - sir-nodeward-nodington-iii (Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document)

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values      | Generalizations |
      | market     | DE, CH      | CH->DE          |
      | language   | de, gsw, fr | gsw->de         |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Content':
      constraints:
        nodeTypes:
          '*': true
          'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': false
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:DocumentWithTetheredChildNode':

          constraints:
            nodeTypes:
              '*': true
              'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Content': false
    """
