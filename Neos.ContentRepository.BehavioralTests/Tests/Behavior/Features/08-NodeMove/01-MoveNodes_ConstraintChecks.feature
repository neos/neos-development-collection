Feature: Move node to a new parent / within the current parent before a sibling / to the end of the sibling list

  As a user of the CR I want to move a node to a new parent / within the current parent before a sibling / to the end of the sibling list,
  without affecting other nodes in the node aggregate.

  These are the base test cases for the NodeAggregateCommandHandler to block invalid commands


  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values                      | Generalizations                      |
      | example    | general, source, spec, peer | spec->source->general, peer->general |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Content':
      constraints:
        nodeTypes:
          '*': true
          'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': false
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:DocumentWithTetheredChildNode':
      childNodes:
        tethered:

              '*': true
              'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Content': false
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:

  Scenario: Using the scatter strategy, try to move a node to a parent whose parent's node type does not allow grand child nodes of the node's type
    Given the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:
      | nodeAggregateId  | originDimensionSpacePoint | nodeTypeName                           | parentNodeAggregateId  | nodeName |

    Then the last command should have thrown an exception of type "NodeConstraintException"

  # Hint: One might come to the conclusion that we also have to check the other strategies.
  # The cases would be that the new parent is partially moved to a new grandparent which then imposes different constraints.
  # Yet these grandparent constraints are only imposed on the children of their tethered children, but the latter by definition cannot be moved.
  # Thus the preconditions for these test cases cannot be established because the needed commands would fail.
