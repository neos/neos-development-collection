Feature: Move a node with content dimensions

  As a user of the CR I want to move a node to a new parent
  - before the first of its new siblings
  - between two of its new siblings
  - after the last of its new siblings

  These are the test cases for moving nodes with content dimensions being involved, which is a lot more fun!

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values           | Generalizations       |
      | language   | mul, de, en, gsw | gsw->de->mul, en->mul |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': []
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                  | Value                |
      | workspaceName        | "live"               |
      | workspaceTitle       | "Live"               |
      | workspaceDescription | "The live workspace" |
      | newContentStreamId   | "cs-identifier"      |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                         |
      | contentStreamId | "cs-identifier"               |
      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |
