Feature: Move a node with content dimensions

  As a user of the CR I want to move a node
  - before the first of its siblings
  - between two of its siblings
  - after the last of its siblings

  These are the test cases for moving nodes with content dimensions being involved, which is a lot more fun!

  Background:
    Given I have the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values           | Generalizations       |
      | language   | mul, de, en, gsw | gsw->de->mul, en->mul |
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': []
    """
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                        | Value                                  |
      | workspaceName              | "live"                                 |
      | workspaceTitle             | "Live"                                 |
      | workspaceDescription       | "The live workspace"                   |
      | newContentStreamId | "cs-identifier"                        |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key                         | Value                                                                              |

    And I expect this node to have the following succeeding siblings:
      | NodeDiscriminator                                 |
      | cs-identifier;berta-destinode;{"language": "mul"} |
      | cs-identifier;carl-destinode;{"language": "mul"}  |

  Scenario: Move a node and its specializations to the end of its siblings
    When the command MoveNodeAggregate is executed with payload:
      | Key                          | Value                   |
      | contentStreamId      | "cs-identifier"         |
      | nodeAggregateId      | "nody-mc-nodeface"      |
      | dimensionSpacePoint          | {"language": "de"}      |
      | relationDistributionStrategy | "gatherSpecializations" |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"language": "mul"}
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "nody-mc-nodeface" and node path "document/child-document-n" to lead to node cs-identifier;nody-mc-nodeface;{"language": "mul"}
    And I expect this node to be a child of node cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{"language": "mul"}
    And I expect this node to have the following preceding siblings:
      | NodeDiscriminator                                   |
      | cs-identifier;berta-destinode;{"language": "mul"}   |
      | cs-identifier;anthony-destinode;{"language": "mul"} |
    And I expect this node to have the following succeeding siblings:
      | NodeDiscriminator                                |
      | cs-identifier;carl-destinode;{"language": "mul"} |

    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"language": "de"}
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "nody-mc-nodeface" and node path "document/child-document-n" to lead to node cs-identifier;nody-mc-nodeface;{"language": "mul"}
    And I expect this node to be a child of node cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{"language": "mul"}
    And I expect this node to have the following preceding siblings:
      | NodeDiscriminator                                   |
      | cs-identifier;carl-destinode;{"language": "mul"}    |
      | cs-identifier;berta-destinode;{"language": "mul"}   |
      | cs-identifier;anthony-destinode;{"language": "mul"} |
    And I expect this node to have no succeeding siblings

    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"language": "gsw"}
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "nody-mc-nodeface" and node path "document/child-document-n" to lead to node cs-identifier;nody-mc-nodeface;{"language": "mul"}
    And I expect this node to be a child of node cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{"language": "mul"}
    And I expect this node to have the following preceding siblings:
      | NodeDiscriminator                                   |

      | cs-identifier;berta-destinode;{"language": "mul"}   |
