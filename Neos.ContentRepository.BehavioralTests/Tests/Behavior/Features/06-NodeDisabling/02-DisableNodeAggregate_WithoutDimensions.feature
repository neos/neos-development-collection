Feature: Disable a node aggregate

  As a user of the CR I want to disable a node aggregate and expect its descendants to also be disabled.

  These are the test cases without dimensions being involved

  Background:
    Given I have no content dimensions
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
    'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document':
      properties:
        references:
          type: references
    """
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                        | Value                |
      | workspaceName              | "live"               |
      | workspaceTitle             | "Live"               |
      | workspaceDescription       | "The live workspace" |
      | newContentStreamIdentifier | "cs-identifier"      |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {}
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key                     | Value                         |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |
      | nodeTypeName            | "Neos.ContentRepository:Root" |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier | nodeTypeName                            | parentNodeAggregateIdentifier | nodeName            |
      | preceding-nodenborough  | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document | lady-eleonode-rootford        | preceding-document  |
      | sir-david-nodenborough  | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document | lady-eleonode-rootford        | document            |
      | succeeding-nodenborough | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document | lady-eleonode-rootford        | succeeding-document |
      | nody-mc-nodeface        | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document | sir-david-nodenborough        | child-document      |
    And the command SetNodeReferences is executed with payload:
      | Key                           | Value                                  |
      | sourceNodeAggregateIdentifier | "preceding-nodenborough"               |
      | referenceName                 | "references"                           |
      | references                    | [{"target": "sir-david-nodenborough"}] |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

  Scenario: Disable node with arbitrary strategy since dimensions are not involved
    When the command DisableNodeAggregate is executed with payload:
      | Key                          | Value                    |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier      | "sir-david-nodenborough" |
      | nodeVariantSelectionStrategy | "allVariants"            |

    Then I expect exactly 8 events to be published on stream with prefix "Neos.ContentRepository:ContentStream:cs-identifier"
    And event at index 7 is of type "NodeAggregateWasDisabled" with payload:
      | Key                          | Expected                     |
      | contentStreamIdentifier      | "cs-identifier"              |
      | nodeAggregateIdentifier      | "sir-david-nodenborough"     |
      | affectedDimensionSpacePoints | [[]]                         |
      | initiatingUserIdentifier     | "initiating-user-identifier" |

    When the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I am in content stream "cs-identifier"
    Then I expect the graph projection to consist of exactly 5 nodes
    And I expect a node identified by cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-rootford;{} to exist in the content graph
    And I expect a node identified by cs-identifier;preceding-nodenborough;{} to exist in the content graph
    And I expect a node identified by cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{} to exist in the content graph
    And I expect a node identified by cs-identifier;succeeding-nodenborough;{} to exist in the content graph
    And I expect a node identified by cs-identifier;nody-mc-nodeface;{} to exist in the content graph

    And I expect the node aggregate "sir-david-nodenborough" to exist
    And I expect this node aggregate to disable dimension space points [{}]

    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {}
    And VisibilityConstraints are set to "withoutRestrictions"
    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "lady-eleonode-rootford" to lead to node cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-rootford;{}
    And I expect this node to have the following child nodes:
      | Name                | NodeDiscriminator                        |
      | preceding-document  | cs-identifier;preceding-nodenborough;{}  |
      | document            | cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{}  |
      | succeeding-document | cs-identifier;succeeding-nodenborough;{} |
    And the subtree for node aggregate "lady-eleonode-rootford" with node types "" and 2 levels deep should be:
      | Level | NodeAggregateIdentifier |
      | 0     | lady-eleonode-rootford  |
      | 1     | preceding-nodenborough  |
      | 1     | sir-david-nodenborough  |
      | 2     | nody-mc-nodeface        |
      | 1     | succeeding-nodenborough |
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "preceding-nodenborough" and node path "preceding-document" to lead to node cs-identifier;preceding-nodenborough;{}
    And I expect this node to be a child of node cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-rootford;{}
    And I expect this node to have no preceding siblings
    And I expect this node to have the following succeeding siblings:
      | NodeDiscriminator                        |
      | cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{}  |
      | cs-identifier;succeeding-nodenborough;{} |
    And I expect this node to have the following references:

      | references | cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{} | null       |
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-david-nodenborough" and node path "document" to lead to node cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{}
    And I expect this node to be a child of node cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-rootford;{}
    And I expect this node to have the following preceding siblings:
      | NodeDiscriminator                       |
      | cs-identifier;preceding-nodenborough;{} |
    And I expect this node to have the following succeeding siblings:
      | NodeDiscriminator                        |
      | cs-identifier;succeeding-nodenborough;{} |
    And I expect this node to be referenced by:
      | Name       | Node                                    | Properties |
      | references | cs-identifier;preceding-nodenborough;{} | null       |
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "succeeding-nodenborough" and node path "succeeding-document" to lead to node cs-identifier;succeeding-nodenborough;{}
    And I expect this node to be a child of node cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-rootford;{}
    And I expect this node to have the following preceding siblings:
      | NodeDiscriminator                       |
      | cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{} |
      | cs-identifier;preceding-nodenborough;{} |
    And I expect this node to have no succeeding siblings
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "nody-mc-nodeface" and node path "document/child-document" to lead to node cs-identifier;nody-mc-nodeface;{}
    And I expect this node to be a child of node cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{}

    When VisibilityConstraints are set to "frontend"
    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "lady-eleonode-rootford" to lead to node cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-rootford;{}
    And I expect this node to have the following child nodes:
      | Name                | NodeDiscriminator                        |
      | preceding-document  | cs-identifier;preceding-nodenborough;{}  |
      | succeeding-document | cs-identifier;succeeding-nodenborough;{} |
    And the subtree for node aggregate "lady-eleonode-rootford" with node types "" and 2 levels deep should be:
      | Level | NodeAggregateIdentifier |
      | 0     | lady-eleonode-rootford  |
      | 1     | preceding-nodenborough  |
      | 1     | succeeding-nodenborough |
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "preceding-nodenborough" and node path "preceding-document" to lead to node cs-identifier;preceding-nodenborough;{}
    And I expect this node to be a child of node cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-rootford;{}
    And I expect this node to have no preceding siblings
    And I expect this node to have the following succeeding siblings:
      | NodeDiscriminator                        |
      | cs-identifier;succeeding-nodenborough;{} |
    And I expect this node to have no references
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-david-nodenborough" and node path "document" to lead to no node

      | NodeDiscriminator                       |
      | cs-identifier;preceding-nodenborough;{} |
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "nody-mc-nodeface" and node path "document/child-document" to lead to no node
