Feature: Variation of hidden nodes

  If we create variants of nodes hidden in the respective dimension space point(s),
  the variants must be hidden as well

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values                | Generalizations                     |
      | language   | mul, de, en, gsw, ltz | ltz->de->mul, gsw->de->mul, en->mul |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': {}
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                        | Value                |
      | workspaceName              | "live"               |
      | workspaceTitle             | "Live"               |
      | workspaceDescription       | "The live workspace" |
      | newContentStreamId | "cs-identifier"      |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"language":"mul"}
