Feature: Remove NodeAggregate

  As a user of the CR I want to be able to remove a NodeAggregate or parts of it.

  These are the test cases without dimensions being involved

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values          | Generalizations     |
      | language   | en, de, gsw, fr | gsw->de->en, fr->en |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document':
      properties:
        references:
          type: references
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                  | Value                |
      | workspaceName        | "live"               |
      | workspaceTitle       | "Live"               |
      | workspaceDescription | "The live workspace" |
      | newContentStreamId   | "cs-identifier"      |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"language":"en"}
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                         |
      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |
      | nodeTypeName    | "Neos.ContentRepository:Root" |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:
      | nodeAggregateId        | nodeTypeName                            | parentNodeAggregateId  | nodeName |
      | sir-david-nodenborough | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document | lady-eleonode-rootford | document |
      | nodingers-cat          | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document | lady-eleonode-rootford | pet      |
      | nodingers-kitten       | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document | nodingers-cat          | kitten   |
    And the command SetNodeReferences is executed with payload:
      | Key                   | Value                                  |
      | sourceNodeAggregateId | "nodingers-cat"                        |
      | referenceName         | "references"                           |
      | references            | [{"target": "sir-david-nodenborough"}] |

  Scenario: Remove a node aggregate with strategy allSpecializations
    When the command RemoveNodeAggregate is executed with payload:
      | Key                          | Value                |
      | nodeAggregateId              | "nodingers-cat"      |
      | coveredDimensionSpacePoint   | {"language":"de"}    |
      | nodeVariantSelectionStrategy | "allSpecializations" |
    Then I expect exactly 7 events to be published on stream with prefix "ContentStream:cs-identifier"
    And event at index 6 is of type "NodeAggregateWasRemoved" with payload:
      | Key                                  | Expected                               |
      | contentStreamId                      | "cs-identifier"                        |
      | nodeAggregateId                      | "nodingers-cat"                        |
      | affectedOccupiedDimensionSpacePoints | [{"language":"en"}]                    |
      | affectedCoveredDimensionSpacePoints  | [{"language":"de"},{"language":"gsw"}] |
      | removalAttachmentPoint               | null                                   |
    When the graph projection is fully up to date
    Then I expect the graph projection to consist of exactly 4 nodes
    And I expect a node identified by cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-rootford;{} to exist in the content graph
    And I expect a node identified by cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{"language":"en"} to exist in the content graph

    And I expect the node aggregate "nodingers-kitten" to exist
    And I expect this node aggregate to cover dimension space points [{"language":"en"},{"language":"fr"}]

    # Check the selected variant

    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "lady-eleonode-rootford" to lead to node cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-rootford;{}
    And I expect this node to have the following child nodes:

      | document | cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{"language":"en"} |
    And the subtree for node aggregate "lady-eleonode-rootford" with node types "" and 2 levels deep should be:
      | Level | nodeAggregateId        |
      | 0     | lady-eleonode-rootford |

  Scenario: Disable a node aggregate, partially remove it, recreate it and expect the recreated nodes to be enabled and have their source's references
    When the command DisableNodeAggregate is executed with payload:
      | Key                          | Value           |
      | nodeAggregateId              | "nodingers-cat" |

    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And the command RemoveNodeAggregate is executed with payload:
      | Key                          | Value                |
      | nodeAggregateId              | "nodingers-cat"      |
      | coveredDimensionSpacePoint   | {"language":"de"}    |
      | nodeVariantSelectionStrategy | "allSpecializations" |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And the command CreateNodeVariant is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value             |

      | sourceOrigin    | {"language":"en"} |

    And the graph projection is fully up to date

    Then I expect the node aggregate "nodingers-cat" to exist
    And I expect this node aggregate to disable dimension space points [{"language":"en"},{"language":"fr"}]
