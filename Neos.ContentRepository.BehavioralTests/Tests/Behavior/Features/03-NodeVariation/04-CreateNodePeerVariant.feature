Feature: Create node peer variant

  As a user of the CR I want to create a copy of a node within an aggregate to a peer dimension space point, i.e. one that is neither a generalization nor a specialization.

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values          | Generalizations |
      | market     | DE, CH          | CH->DE          |
      | language   | en, de, fr, gsw | gsw->de->en     |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Tethered': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:TetheredDocument':
      childNodes:
        tethered:
          type: 'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Tethered'
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document':
      childNodes:
        tethered-document:
          type: 'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:TetheredDocument'
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:DocumentWithoutTetheredChildren': []
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                  | Value                |
      | workspaceName        | "live"               |
      | workspaceTitle       | "Live"               |
      | workspaceDescription | "The live workspace" |
      | newContentStreamId   | "cs-identifier"      |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"market":"DE", "language":"en"}
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                         |
      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |
      | nodeTypeName    | "Neos.ContentRepository:Root" |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:
      | nodeAggregateId        | originDimensionSpacePoint        | nodeName            | parentNodeAggregateId  | nodeTypeName                                                   | tetheredDescendantNodeAggregateIds                                                       |
    # We have to add another node since root nodes have no origin dimension space points and thus cannot be varied.
    # We also need a tethered child node to test that it is reachable from the freshly created peer variant of the parent
    # and we need a tethered child node of the tethered child node to test that this works recursively
      | sir-david-nodenborough | {"market":"DE", "language":"en"} | document            | lady-eleonode-rootford | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document                        | {"tethered-document": "nodimus-prime", "tethered-document/tethered": "nodimus-mediocre"} |
    # and we need a non-tethered child node to make sure it is _not_ reachable from the freshly created peer variant of the parent

    # We have to add another node as a peer.

    # and we need a non-tethered child node to make sure it is _not_ reachable from the freshly created peer variant of the parent

  Scenario: Create peer variant of node to dimension space point without specializations
    When the command CreateNodeVariant is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                            |

      | sourceOrigin    | {"market":"DE", "language":"en"} |
      | targetOrigin    | {"market":"CH", "language":"fr"} |
    Then I expect exactly 13 events to be published on stream "ContentStream:cs-identifier"
    And event at index 10 is of type "NodePeerVariantWasCreated" with payload:
      | Key             | Expected                           |

    And event at index 11 is of type "NodePeerVariantWasCreated" with payload:

      | peerOrigin      | {"market":"CH", "language":"fr"}   |
      | peerCoverage    | [{"market":"CH", "language":"fr"}] |
    And event at index 12 is of type "NodePeerVariantWasCreated" with payload:

  Scenario: Create a peer node variant to a dimension space point with specializations and where the parent node aggregate is already specialized in
