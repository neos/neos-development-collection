Feature: Create node peer variant

  As a user of the CR I want to create a copy of a node within an aggregate to a peer dimension space point, i.e. one that is neither a generalization nor a specialization.

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values               | Generalizations |
      | example    | source,peer,peerSpec | peerSpec->peer  |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Tethered': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:TetheredDocument':
      childNodes:
        tethered:
          type: 'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Tethered'
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document':
      childNodes:
        tethered-document:
          type: 'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:TetheredDocument'
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:DocumentWithoutTetheredChildren': []
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                  | Value                |
      | workspaceName        | "live"               |
      | workspaceTitle       | "Live"               |
      | workspaceDescription | "The live workspace" |
      | newContentStreamId   | "cs-identifier"      |
    And I am in workspace "live" and dimension space point {"example":"source"}
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                         |
      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |
      | nodeTypeName    | "Neos.ContentRepository:Root" |
    And the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:
      | nodeAggregateId        | originDimensionSpacePoint | nodeName            | parentNodeAggregateId  | succeedingSiblingNodeAggregateId | nodeTypeName                                                   | tetheredDescendantNodeAggregateIds                                                            |
    # We have to add another node since root nodes have no origin dimension space points and thus cannot be varied.
    # We also need a tethered child node to test that it is reachable from the freshly created peer variant of the parent
    # and we need a tethered child node of the tethered child node to test that this works recursively

  Scenario: Create peer variant of node to dimension space point with specialization
    When the command CreateNodeVariant is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                |
      | nodeAggregateId | "nody-mc-nodeface"   |
      | sourceOrigin    | {"example":"source"} |
      | targetOrigin    | {"example":"peer"}   |
    And the command CreateNodeVariant is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                |
      | nodeAggregateId | "elder-mc-nodeface"  |
      | sourceOrigin    | {"example":"source"} |
      | targetOrigin    | {"example":"peer"}   |
    # Complete the sibling set with a node in the target DSP between the middle and last node
    And the command CreateNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key                       | Value                                                            |
      | nodeAggregateId           | "younger-mc-nodeface"                                            |

      | parentNodeAggregateId     | "lady-eleonode-rootford"                                         |
      | originDimensionSpacePoint | {"example":"peer"}                                               |
      | nodeName                  | "younger-document"                                               |
    And the command CreateNodeVariant is executed with payload:
