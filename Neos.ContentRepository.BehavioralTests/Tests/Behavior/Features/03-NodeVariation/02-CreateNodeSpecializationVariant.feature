Feature: Create node specialization

  As a user of the CR I want to create a copy of a node within an aggregate to a more specialized dimension space point.

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values      | Generalizations |
      | market     | DE, CH      | CH->DE          |
      | language   | en, de, gsw | gsw->de->en     |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document':
      childNodes:
        tethered-node:
          type: 'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Tethered'
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Tethered':
      childNodes:
        tethered-leaf:
          type: 'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:TetheredLeaf'
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:TetheredLeaf': []
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:LeafDocument': []
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                  | Value                |
      | workspaceName        | "live"               |
      | workspaceTitle       | "Live"               |
      | workspaceDescription | "The live workspace" |
      | newContentStreamId   | "cs-identifier"      |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"market":"DE", "language":"en"}
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                         |
      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |
      | nodeTypeName    | "Neos.ContentRepository:Root" |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

    And the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:
      | nodeAggregateId        | nodeName       | parentNodeAggregateId  | nodeTypeName                                | tetheredDescendantNodeAggregateIds                                                         |
    # We have to add another node since root node aggregates do not support variation
    # Node /document
      | sir-david-nodenborough | document       | lady-eleonode-rootford | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document     | {"tethered-node": "nodewyn-tetherton", "tethered-node/tethered-leaf": "nodimer-tetherton"} |
    # We also want to add a child node to make sure it is still reachable after creating a specialization of the parent
    # Node /document/child-document
      | nody-mc-nodeface       | child-document | sir-david-nodenborough | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:LeafDocument | {}                                                                                         |

  Scenario: check the tree state before the specialization
    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"market":"DE", "language":"en"}
    And the subtree for node aggregate "sir-david-nodenborough" with node types "" and 2 levels deep should be:
      | Level | nodeAggregateId        |
      | 0     | sir-david-nodenborough |
      | 1     | nodewyn-tetherton      |
      | 2     | nodimer-tetherton      |
      | 1     | nody-mc-nodeface       |

  Scenario: Create specialization of node to dimension space point without further specializations
    When the command CreateNodeVariant is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                             |
      | nodeAggregateId | "sir-david-nodenborough"          |
      | sourceOrigin    | {"market":"DE", "language":"en"}  |
      | targetOrigin    | {"market":"CH", "language":"gsw"} |
    Then I expect exactly 9 events to be published on stream "ContentStream:cs-identifier"
    # The first event is NodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated
    And event at index 6 is of type "NodeSpecializationVariantWasCreated" with payload:
      | Key                    | Expected                            |
      | contentStreamId        | "cs-identifier"                     |
      | nodeAggregateId        | "sir-david-nodenborough"            |
      | sourceOrigin           | {"market":"DE", "language":"en"}    |
      | specializationOrigin   | {"market":"CH", "language":"gsw"}   |
      | specializationCoverage | [{"market":"CH", "language":"gsw"}] |

    # The first event is NodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated
    And event at index 7 is of type "NodeSpecializationVariantWasCreated" with payload:
      | Key                    | Expected                            |
      | contentStreamId        | "cs-identifier"                     |
      | nodeAggregateId        | "nodewyn-tetherton"                 |
      | sourceOrigin           | {"market":"DE", "language":"en"}    |

    # The first event is NodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated
    And event at index 8 is of type "NodeSpecializationVariantWasCreated" with payload:
      | Key                    | Expected                            |

  Scenario: Create specialization of node to dimension space point that is already covered
    Given the command CreateNodeVariant is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                            |
      | nodeAggregateId | "sir-david-nodenborough"         |
      | sourceOrigin    | {"market":"DE", "language":"en"} |
      | targetOrigin    | {"market":"DE", "language":"de"} |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    When the command CreateNodeVariant is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                             |
      | nodeAggregateId | "sir-david-nodenborough"          |
      | sourceOrigin    | {"market":"DE", "language":"en"}  |
      | targetOrigin    | {"market":"DE", "language":"gsw"} |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"market":"DE", "language":"en"}
    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-david-nodenborough" and node path "document" to lead to node cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{"market":"DE", "language":"en"}
    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"market":"DE", "language":"de"}
    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-david-nodenborough" and node path "document" to lead to node cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{"market":"DE", "language":"de"}
    When I am in content stream "cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"market":"DE", "language":"gsw"}
    Then I expect node aggregate identifier "sir-david-nodenborough" and node path "document" to lead to node cs-identifier;sir-david-nodenborough;{"market":"DE", "language":"gsw"}
