Feature: Add Dimension Specialization

  This is needed if "de" exists, and you want to create a "de_CH" specialization:
  - there, you want to create EDGES for de_CH, without materializing NODES (so that the shine-through works as expected)

  !! NOTE: We can NOT trigger SPECIALIZATION of all nodes using the existing events; because this materializes the nodes.

  !! Constraint: the Target Dimension Space should be empty.
