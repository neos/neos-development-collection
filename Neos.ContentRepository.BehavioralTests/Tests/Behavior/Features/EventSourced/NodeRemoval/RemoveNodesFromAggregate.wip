Feature: Remove Nodes from Aggregate

  As a user of the CR I want to be able to remove a node.

  This feature tests the following combinations:
  - workspaces:
  - (1) LIVE
  - (2) USER workspace
  - children:
  - (A) WITHOUT children
  - (B) WITH children
  - Dimensions:
  - (a) with dimension shine-through - when both DimensionSpacePoints are scheduled to be deleted, the node is actually removed fully.
  - (b) with explicit variant in another dimension (deleting the "child dimension" node; node still needs to exist in "parent dimension")

  Background:
    Given I have the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Default | Values  | Generalizations |
      | language   | de      | de, gsw | gsw->de         |
    And I have the following NodeTypes configuration:
    """
