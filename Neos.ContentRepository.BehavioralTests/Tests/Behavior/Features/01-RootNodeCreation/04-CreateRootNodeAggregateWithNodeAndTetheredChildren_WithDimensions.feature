Feature: Create a root node aggregate with tethered children

  As a user of the CR I want to create a new root node aggregate with an initial node and tethered children.

  These are the test cases with dimensions involved

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values             | Generalizations    |
      | language   | de, en, gsw, en_US | en_US->en, gsw->de |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:SubSubNode':
      properties:
        text:
          defaultValue: 'my sub sub default'
          type: string
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:SubNode':
      childNodes:
        grandchild-node:
          type: 'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:SubSubNode'
      properties:
        text:
          defaultValue: 'my sub default'
          type: string
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:RootWithTetheredChildNodes':
      superTypes:
        'Neos.ContentRepository:Root': true
      childNodes:
        child-node:
          type: 'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:SubNode'
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                  | Value                |
      | workspaceName        | "live"               |
      | workspaceTitle       | "Live"               |
      | workspaceDescription | "The live workspace" |
      | newContentStreamId   | "cs-identifier"      |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I am in content stream "cs-identifier"
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"

  Scenario: Create root node with tethered children
    When the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key                                | Value                                                                             |
      | nodeAggregateId                    | "lady-eleonode-rootford"                                                          |
      | nodeTypeName                       | "Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:RootWithTetheredChildNodes"                       |
      | tetheredDescendantNodeAggregateIds | {"child-node": "nody-mc-nodeface", "child-node/grandchild-node": "nodimus-prime"} |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

    Then I expect exactly 6 events to be published on stream "ContentStream:cs-identifier"
    And event at index 1 is of type "RootNodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated" with payload:
      | Key                         | Expected                                                                             |
