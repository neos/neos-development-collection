Feature: Create node aggregate with node

  As a user of the CR I want to create a new externally referencable node aggregate of a specific type with a node
  in a specific dimension space point.

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values           | Generalizations       |
      | language   | mul, de, en, gsw | gsw->de->mul, en->mul |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:NodeWithoutTetheredChildNodes':
      properties:
        defaultText:
          defaultValue: 'my default'
          type: string
        text:
          type: string
        nullText:
          type: string
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And I am user identified by "initiating-user-identifier"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                  | Value                |
      | workspaceName        | "live"               |
      | workspaceTitle       | "Live"               |
      | workspaceDescription | "The live workspace" |
      | newContentStreamId   | "cs-identifier"      |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I am in content stream "cs-identifier"
    And the command CreateRootNodeAggregateWithNode is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value                         |
      | nodeAggregateId | "lady-eleonode-rootford"      |
      | nodeTypeName    | "Neos.ContentRepository:Root" |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

  Scenario:  Create node aggregate with initial node with content dimensions
    When the following CreateNodeAggregateWithNode commands are executed:
      | nodeAggregateId            | originDimensionSpacePoint | nodeName   | parentNodeAggregateId  | nodeTypeName                                                 | initialPropertyValues    |
      | sir-david-nodenborough     | {"language":"mul"}        | node       | lady-eleonode-rootford | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:NodeWithoutTetheredChildNodes | {"text": "initial text"} |
      | nody-mc-nodeface           | {"language":"de"}         | child-node | sir-david-nodenborough | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:NodeWithoutTetheredChildNodes | {}                       |
      | sir-nodeward-nodington-iii | {"language":"en"}         | esquire    | lady-eleonode-rootford | Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:NodeWithoutTetheredChildNodes | {}                       |

    Then I expect exactly 5 events to be published on stream "ContentStream:cs-identifier"
    And event at index 2 is of type "NodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated" with payload:
      | Key                         | Expected                                                                                                        |
      | contentStreamId             | "cs-identifier"                                                                                                 |

      | coveredDimensionSpacePoints | [{"language":"mul"},{"language":"de"},{"language":"en"},{"language":"gsw"}]                                     |

      | nodeName                    | "node"                                                                                                          |
      | initialPropertyValues       | {"defaultText": {"value": "my default", "type": "string"}, "text": {"value": "initial text", "type": "string"}} |
      | nodeAggregateClassification | "regular"                                                                                                       |
    And event at index 3 is of type "NodeAggregateWithNodeWasCreated" with payload:
