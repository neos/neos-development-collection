  Scenario: Original created and last modified timestamps when publishing nodes over multiple content streams
    When the current date and time is "2023-03-16T13:00:00+01:00"
    And the command SetNodeProperties is executed with payload:
      | Key             | Value               |
      | contentStreamId | "cs-user"           |
      | nodeAggregateId | "a"                 |
      | propertyValues  | {"text": "Changed"} |
    And I execute the findNodeById query for node aggregate id "non-existing" I expect no node to be returned
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And the current date and time is "2023-03-16T14:00:00+01:00"
    And the command PublishWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key           | Value       |
      | workspaceName | "user-test" |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

    And I am in content stream "cs-user"
    Then I expect the node "a" to have the following timestamps:
      | created             | originalCreated     | lastModified        | originalLastModified |
      | 2023-03-16 12:00:00 | 2023-03-16 12:00:00 | 2023-03-16 13:00:00 | 2023-03-16 13:00:00  |
    And I expect the node "b" to have the following timestamps:
      | created             | originalCreated     | lastModified | originalLastModified |
      | 2023-03-16 12:00:00 | 2023-03-16 12:00:00 |              |                      |

    And I am in content stream "cs-review"
    Then I expect the node "a" to have the following timestamps:
      | created             | originalCreated     | lastModified        | originalLastModified |
      | 2023-03-16 14:00:00 | 2023-03-16 12:00:00 | 2023-03-16 14:00:00 | 2023-03-16 13:00:00  |
    And I expect the node "b" to have the following timestamps:
      | created             | originalCreated     | lastModified | originalLastModified |
      | 2023-03-16 14:00:00 | 2023-03-16 12:00:00 |              |                      |

    When the current date and time is "2023-03-16T15:00:00+01:00"
    And the command PublishWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key           | Value    |
      | workspaceName | "review" |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date
    And I am in content stream "cs-live"
    Then I expect the node "a" to have the following timestamps:
      | created             | originalCreated     | lastModified        | originalLastModified |
      | 2023-03-16 15:00:00 | 2023-03-16 12:00:00 | 2023-03-16 15:00:00 | 2023-03-16 13:00:00  |
    And I expect the node "b" to have the following timestamps:
      | created             | originalCreated     | lastModified | originalLastModified |
      | 2023-03-16 15:00:00 | 2023-03-16 12:00:00 |              |                      |
