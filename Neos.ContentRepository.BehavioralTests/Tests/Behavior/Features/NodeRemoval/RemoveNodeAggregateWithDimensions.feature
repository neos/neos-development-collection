Feature: Remove NodeAggregate

  As a user of the CR I want to be able to remove a NodeAggregate completely.

  Background:
    Given using the following content dimensions:
      | Identifier | Values  | Generalizations |
      | language   | de, gsw | gsw->de         |
    And using the following node types:
    """yaml
    'Neos.ContentRepository.Testing:Document': []
    """
    And using identifier "default", I define a content repository
    And I am in content repository "default"
    And the command CreateRootWorkspace is executed with payload:
      | Key                        | Value                                  |

  # Section: EXTRA testcases

  Scenario: In LIVE workspace, removing a NodeAggregate removes all nodes completely
    When the command RemoveNodeAggregate is executed with payload:
      | Key                          | Value                |
      | contentStreamId      | "live-cs-identifier" |
      | nodeAggregateId      | "nody-mc-nodeface"   |
      | nodeVariantSelectionStrategy | "allVariants"        |
      | coveredDimensionSpacePoint   | {"language":"de"}    |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

    Then I expect the graph projection to consist of exactly 1 node
    And I expect a node identified by live-cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-nodesworth;{} to exist in the content graph

    When I am in content stream "live-cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"language":"de"}
    Then I expect the subgraph projection to consist of exactly 1 nodes
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "lady-eleonode-nodesworth" to lead to node live-cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-nodesworth;{}

    When I am in content stream "live-cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"language":"gsw"}
    Then I expect the subgraph projection to consist of exactly 1 nodes
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "lady-eleonode-nodesworth" to lead to node live-cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-nodesworth;{}

  Scenario: In USER workspace, removing a NodeAggregate removes all nodes completely; leaving the live workspace untouched

    When the command "ForkContentStream" is executed with payload:
      | Key                           | Value                        |
      | contentStreamId       | "user-cs-identifier"         |
      | sourceContentStreamId | "live-cs-identifier"         |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

    When the command RemoveNodeAggregate is executed with payload:
      | Key                          | Value                |
      | contentStreamId      | "user-cs-identifier" |
      | nodeAggregateId      | "nody-mc-nodeface"   |
      | nodeVariantSelectionStrategy | "allVariants"        |
      | coveredDimensionSpacePoint   | {"language":"de"}    |
    And the graph projection is fully up to date

    Then I expect the graph projection to consist of exactly 4 nodes
    And I expect a node identified by live-cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-nodesworth;{} to exist in the content graph
    And I expect a node identified by live-cs-identifier;nody-mc-nodeface;{"language":"de"} to exist in the content graph
    And I expect a node identified by live-cs-identifier;nody-mc-nodeface;{"language":"gsw"} to exist in the content graph
    And I expect a node identified by live-cs-identifier;nodimus-prime;{"language":"de"} to exist in the content graph

    When I am in content stream "user-cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"language":"de"}
    Then I expect the subgraph projection to consist of exactly 1 nodes
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "lady-eleonode-nodesworth" to lead to node user-cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-nodesworth;{}

    When I am in content stream "user-cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"language":"gsw"}
    Then I expect the subgraph projection to consist of exactly 1 nodes
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "lady-eleonode-nodesworth" to lead to node user-cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-nodesworth;{}

    # ensure LIVE ContentStream is untouched
    When I am in content stream "live-cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"language":"de"}
    Then I expect the subgraph projection to consist of exactly 3 nodes
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "lady-eleonode-nodesworth" to lead to node live-cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-nodesworth;{}
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "nody-mc-nodeface" and node path "document" to lead to node live-cs-identifier;nody-mc-nodeface;{"language":"de"}
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "nodimus-prime" and node path "document/child-document" to lead to node live-cs-identifier;nodimus-prime;{"language":"de"}

    When I am in content stream "live-cs-identifier" and dimension space point {"language":"gsw"}
    Then I expect the subgraph projection to consist of exactly 3 nodes
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "lady-eleonode-nodesworth" to lead to node live-cs-identifier;lady-eleonode-nodesworth;{}
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "nody-mc-nodeface" and node path "document" to lead to node live-cs-identifier;nody-mc-nodeface;{"language":"gsw"}
    And I expect node aggregate identifier "nodimus-prime" and node path "document/child-document" to lead to node live-cs-identifier;nodimus-prime;{"language":"de"}
