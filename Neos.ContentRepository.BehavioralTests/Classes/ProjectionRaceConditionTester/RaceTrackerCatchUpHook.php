/**
 * We had some race conditions in projections, where {@see \Neos\ContentRepository\Core\Infrastructure\DbalCheckpointStorage} was not working properly.
 * We saw some non-deterministic, random errors when running the tests - unluckily only on Linux, not on OSX:
 * On OSX, forking a new subprocess in {@see SubprocessProjectionCatchUpTrigger} is *WAY* slower than in Linux;
 * and thus the race conditions which appears if two projector instances of the same class run concurrently
 * won't happen (or are way less likely).
 *
 *
 * ## Our Goal: Detect if/when a Projection runs twice at the same time.
 *
 * The system must ENSURE that a given projection NEVER runs concurrently; so this is the case we need to detect.
 *
 * This means, the following is the behavior we want to have:
 *
 * ```
 * Process A         acquireLock(  |[  ) processEvent() releaseLock(  ]  )
 * Process B             acquireLock(  |                                [  ) processEvent() releaseLock(  ]  )
 * ```
 *
 * (i.e. Process B will wait inside acquireLock() until the lock is released (i.e. Process A finished), and then
 * continue.
 *
 *
 * A WRONG and UNDEFINED behavior looks as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * Process A         acquireLock(  |[  )  applyEvent()  releaseLock(  ]  )
 * Process B             acquireLock(  | [ )  applyEvent()  releaseLock(  ]  )
 *                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 *                                        During this time period, two
 *                                        processes run the projection
 *                                        concurrently.
 * ```
 *
 *
 * **Legend for the flow diagrams above**
 *
 * ```
 * --> time   |            [                             ]
 *            ^            ^                             ^
 *    try to acquire     lock acquired                  lock released
 *    the lock
 * ```
 *
 *
 * ## Implementation Idea: Race Detector with Redis
 *
 * We implement a custom CatchUpHook (this class {@see RaceTrackerCatchUpHook}) which is notified during
 * the projection run.
 *
 * When {@see onBeforeEvent} is called, we know that we are inside applyEvent() in the diagram above,
 * thus we know the lock *HAS* been acquired.
 * When {@see onBeforeBatchCompleted}is called, we know the lock will be released directly afterwards.
 *
 * We track these timings across processes in a single Redis Stream. Because Redis is single-threaded,
 * we can be sure that we observe the correct, total order of interleavings *across multiple processes*
 * inside the single trace.
 *
 *
 * ## Race Detector Algorithm
 *
 * We sequentially go through the stream, we continuously track for which PIDs a transaction is currently
 * open.
 *
 * When a transaction is open for more than one PID, we know that we found a race.
 *
 * This algorithm is implemented in {@see TraceEntries::findProjectionConcurrencyViolations()}.
 *
 *
 * ## Duplicate Processing Algorithm
 *
 * At the same time, an Event should never be processed multiple times by the same Projector. We additionally
 * detect this by remembering the sequence numbers of seen events; and if we have already seen the sequence
 * number already, we know this is an error. This is implemented in {@see TraceEntries::findDoubleProcessingOfEvents()}.
