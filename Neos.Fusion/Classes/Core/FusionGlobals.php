/**
 * Fusion allows to add variable to the context either via
 * \@context.foo = "bar" or by leveraging the php api {@see Runtime::pushContext()}.
 *
 * Those approaches are highly dynamic and don't guarantee the existence of variables,
 * as they have to be explicitly preserved in uncached \@cache segments,
 * or might accidentally be popped from the stack.
 *
 * The Fusion runtime is instantiated with a set of global variables which contain the EEL helper definitions
 * or functions like FlowQuery. Also, variables like "request" are made available via it.
 *
 * The "${request}" special case: To make the request available in uncached segments, it would need to be serialized,
 * but we don't allow this currently and despite that, it would be absurd to cache a random request.
 * This is avoided by always exposing the current action request via the global variable.
 *
 * Overriding Fusion globals is disallowed via \@context and {@see Runtime::pushContext()}.
